This is a collection of code files for various data processing, manipulation and
analysis or simply for fun by Zhan Li, zhanli86@bu.edu. 

Its name 'misc' does Not mean these code files are not important. Think TWICE
before you try to delete or clean some file. They might be super important to
Zhan Li's work. 

At some point, when some code files are settled down and become a complete set
of some program, they should be moved out of this folder and set up a separate
repository!
